To run the server 1 and server 2 use respective files enter the port number that
    you want to use as a command line argument as shown in the tutorial.pdf file shared
Other option to enter it is given in the file of server1.py and server2.py

Use client as per the instructions in tutorial.pdf

After running the server as
"python server1.py 5000"
"python server2.py 5000"
run the client the a message will be displayed for connected 

I have included some extra headers in the client.c to remove warnings 
They are:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>

I have tested server 1 and 2 for:
    Positive numbers for all four arithmetic operations
    Negative numbers for all four arithmetic operations
    It is expected that the numbers and operator will be separated by space and the whole input will 
        be trimmed of extra space at the beginning and end just as explained in the tutorial.pdf 

All the tests that were mentioned were performed and both the servers passed the tests
